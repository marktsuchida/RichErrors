# Traditionally Doxyfiles often start out as the output of `doxygen -g` and
# contain all the settings with comments, and `doxygen -u` is used to update
# for a new version of Doxygen. Here we only specify the settings that differ
# from the default. Upgrading should be done manually by comparing with the
# default settings using `doxygen -x`.
